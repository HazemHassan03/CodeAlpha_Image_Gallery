# CodeAlpha_Image_Gallery
This is an Image gallery I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Features:
1. Navigation between several images.
2. When it reaches the last image the next button moves to the first image.
3. When it is at the first image the previous button moves to the last image.
4. When you click on an image it will move to it.
5. On Mobile Phones it acts like stories.
